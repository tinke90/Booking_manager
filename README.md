## How did i came up with this idea?

```
 I had one project that i though i would have some monitoring side application
 that note when ever new data was received. Internet was full of different kind of
 ready ideas and packages but i decided to create some simple version that does the job.
```

## Usage:
 Basic usage is to move the app to the server and run it.
